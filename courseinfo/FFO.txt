<!--COURSE INFO-->
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The three-day Field Force Operations course provides state and local law enforcement personnel with the knowledge and skills necessary to manage and control crowds and demonstrations. Responders learn critical-thinking and intuitive decision-making skills that support safe and responsive action in regaining order. Responders receive instruction in protest types and actions, legal considerations, responsibilities of mobile field force teams, and crowd-control methods. The course culminates in a series of hands-on activities that allow responders to practice all of the learned skills (baton-holding positions, mass-arrest procedures, and riot-control formations) in a realistic context.</p>
