<!--COURSE INFO-->
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Hazardous Materials Operations (HAZMAT OPS) course is a five-day course that provides responders with the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to analyze, plan, and implement performance-defensive response actions for hazardous materials (HAZMAT) incidents. During this course, students receive instruction and hands-on experience in the knowledge, activities and responsibilities required of operations-level HAZMAT responders. Students perform advanced, practical tasks in the Nation's only toxic chemical-agent training facility, the Chemical, Ordnance, Biological and Radiological (COBRA) Training Facility. This course trains responders to National Fire Protection Association&reg (NFPA&reg) 472: Standard for Competence of Responders to Hazardous Materials/Weapons of Mass Destruction Incidents (2013 ed.) operations-level competence (chapters 5, 6.2, 6.4, and 6.6).</p>
<p>Below are some, but not all, of the critical skill sets learned during this training program:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Identify hazardous materials containers.</li>
    <li>Identify sources of hazardous materials response information.</li>
    <li>Identify types of hazardous materials.</li>
    <li>Identify properties of hazardous materials.</li>
    <li>Identify behaviors of hazardous materials.</li>
    <li>Perform response planning for hazardous materials incidents.</li>
