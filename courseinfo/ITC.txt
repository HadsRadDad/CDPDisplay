<!--COURSE INFO-->
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Instructor Training Course (ITC) is a five-day course that prepares emergency responders to deliver lectures and hands-on training in their local jurisdictions. The course is conducted in two phases: fundamental principles and applied principles. During the fundamental principles phase participants receive an overview of adult learning, task analysis, risk and hazard analysis, learning objectives and lesson plans, communication skills, instructional delivery and multimedia, testing and evaluations, and after action reviews. Then, during the applied principles phase, participants put these lessons into practice through a series of practice training sessions.</p>
