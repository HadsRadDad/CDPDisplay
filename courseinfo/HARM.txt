<!--COURSE INFO-->
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Hazard Assessment and Response Management for CBRNE Incidents (HARM), a three-day course, challenges individuals assembled from different disciplines and geographic areas to apply their operational knowledge as members of a hazardous materials (HAZMAT) team responding to a chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, or explosive (CBRNE) incident. The course simulates the activation and deployment of a team into an active operational incident. Responders arrive in the 36th operational hour of the incident and are assigned as a HAZMAT team. The team is briefed and assigned a daily rotational period recurring over three days. Participants apply operational knowledge and skills from all emergency response disciplines in support of a HAZMAT team and assist in mitigating a CBRNE incident. All students perform tasks and respond to a variety of events in the Nation's only toxic chemical-agent training facility, the Chemical, Ordnance, Biological and Radiological (COBRA) Training Facility.</p>
<p>Below are some, but not all, of the critical skill sets learned during this training program:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prepare for deployment to a CBRNE incident.</li>
<li>Employ the appropriate skills, methods, and equipment necessary to respond to a CBRNE incident.</li>
<li>Develop a plan of action for a CBRNE incident.</li>
<li>Respond effectively to a CBRNE incident.</li>
<li>Conduct advanced operational tasks including designing the plan of action to detect, control, and mitigate CBRNE materials.</li>
</ul>
