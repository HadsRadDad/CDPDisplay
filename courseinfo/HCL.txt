<!--COURSE INFO-->
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Healthcare Leadership for Mass Casualty Incidents is a four-day course that addresses disaster preparedness at the facility and system level. Healthcare leaders must be prepared for any incident that results in multiple casualties, whether it is the result of a natural disaster; an accidental or intentional release of a chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, or explosives (CBRNE) hazard; or a disease outbreak that results in an epidemic or pandemic. This course focuses on preparing healthcare leaders to make critical decisions in all-hazards disaster emergency preparedness activities. Responders learn essential disaster-planning response and recovery functions through lecture/discussion format that are then applied in a tabletop exercise and a two-day functional exercise.</p>
<p>Below are some, but not all, of the critical skill sets learned during this training program:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Clarify healthcare emergency management roles and responsibilities in the disaster life-cycle process-mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery for all-hazards disasters</li>
