This methodology goes beyond the planning guidance provided in CPG-101 and incorporates the unique planning aspects of FEMA’s REP Program. The instructional delivery is designed to create a collaborative training environment supporting discussions focused on the vertical and horizontal integration of emergency operation plans and implementation procedures between neighboring OROs and governmental authorities, providing best-practices and lessons-learned solutions to emergency planning.</p>
<p>At the completion of the course, the student shall be able to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Describe the planning evaluation criteria found in NUREG-0654/FEMA-REP-1, Rev. 1 and the FEMA approved approaches for meeting the intent of the planning standards.</li>
