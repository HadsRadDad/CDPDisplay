<!--COURSE TITLE--><h1><center>Initial Law Enforcement Response to Suicide Bomb Attacks (ILERSBA)</center></h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Initial Law Enforcement Response to Suicide Bombing Attacks (ILERSBA) is a one-day course that was developed with support and cooperation from the Department of Homeland Security, National Bomb Squad Commanders Advisory Board, and New Mexico Tech. It is designed to provide front-line law enforcement officers with the skills and knowledge to effectively interdict and respond to an imminent suicide bombing attack—whether person-borne or vehicle-borne—or a non-suicide attack involving a vehicle-borne device. Additionally, this course addresses the training gap of first-line officers in making immediate decisions when faced with improvised explosive device attacks. The course offers a blend of classroom presentations and practical exercises designed to familiarize participants with procedures for safe and effective responses to suicide-bombing attacks.</p>
