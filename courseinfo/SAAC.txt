<h1><center>Spectroscopic Alarm Adjudication (SAAC)</center></h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The purpose of this course is to equip federal, military, state, local, tribal, and territorial entities who provide mid-level reachback support with the analysis skills and knowledge necessary to rapidly analyze gamma-ray spectra, identify the radionuclides involved, and ultimately perform initial adjudication of radiation alarms. A major component of the course is focused on mastery of the PeakEasy spectroscopy analysis software tool for radionuclide identification. A secondary focus of the course emphasizes proficiency in escalating radiation alarm events to Triage for adjudication when mid-level reachback is insufficient to rule out a potential threat.</p>
<p>Below are some, but not all, of the critical skill sets learned during this training program.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Confirm or deny the presence of various radionuclides by analyzing gamma-ray spectra using PeakEasy</li>
    <li>Describe the function of the DNDO and in particular the services provided by the Joint Analysis Center (JAC) to federal, military, state, local, tribal, and territorial entities</li>
    <li>Perform an adjudication (threat/no-threat assessment) of a radiation alarm event by analyzing gamma-ray spectra in the context of the totality of circumstances (e.g., neutron count rates, dose rates, spatial distribution of radioactive source, photos, event scenario, object description, etc.) surrounding an event</li>
	<li>Identify additional measurements or information which would help accelerate the final adjudication of a radiation alarm event</li>
	<li>Describe the overall radiological/nuclear threat</li>
	<li>Identify those materials suitable for use in Radiological Dispersion Devices (RDD), Radiological Explosion Devices (RED), and Improvised Nuclear Devices (IND)</li>
	<li>Recognize when a radiation alarm event meets the criteria for escalation to Triage for adjudication and response</li>
	<li>Submit a comprehensive radiation alarm event package to Triage for alarm adjudication and response</li>
</ul>
